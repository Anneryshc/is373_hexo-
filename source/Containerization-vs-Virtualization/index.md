    <tr>
      <td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
      <td>A lightweight method of running isolated applications in the same operating system using containers.</td>
      <td>A technology that allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server, each with its own OS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>How it Works</strong></td>
      <td>Containers package the application and its dependencies together but share the host system’s OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.</td>
      <td>Virtualization uses a hypervisor to create and manage VMs, each running a complete, isolated operating system with dedicated resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Advantages</strong></td>
      <td>- Faster startup ⏱️<br>- Less resource usage 💡<br>- Easier to move between different environments 🌍</td>
      <td>- Greater isolation 🛡️<br>- Can run different OS types 🖥️ on the same hardware</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Use Case</strong></td>
      <td>Ideal for microservices, cloud-native apps, and when you need quick and consistent deployment 🚀.</td>
      <td>Best for running multiple operating systems on one machine, legacy applications, and situations requiring strong isolation 🔐.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key Differences</strong></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Containers are more efficient and faster since they share the host OS.</li>
          <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Lighter isolation but quicker to start and consume fewer resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Containers generally perform better because they use fewer resources and start up faster.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Requires more resources due to having their own OS.</li>
          <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Stronger due to separate OS instances.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Slower startup and higher resource usage due to OS overhead.</li>
        </ul>
