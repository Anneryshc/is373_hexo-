## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration in the context of IT and cloud computing refers to the automated configuration, coordination, and management of systems, services, and applications. Its primary purpose is to streamline and automate complex workflows, allowing various interconnected components to work together efficiently. Orchestration ensures that processes that might require multiple tasks, resources, or systems, such as provisioning servers, managing virtual machines, or running containerized applications, are automatically handled without the need for manual intervention.

In simpler terms, orchestration brings together various technologies or services to work in harmony, ensuring that they perform their tasks in a seamless, coordinated manner. It provides automation for operations that involve multiple steps, such as application deployment, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance, which would otherwise be error-prone or resource-intensive if done manually.

Some well-known orchestration tools include:

* Kubernetes (container orchestration)
* Ansible (configuration management and automation)
* Apache Airflow (workflow orchestration)

## What is container orchestration used for?

Use container orchestration to automate and manage tasks such as:

* Provisioning and deployment
* Configuration and scheduling 
* Resource allocation
* Container availability 
* Scaling or removing containers based on balancing workloads across your infrastructure
* Load balancing and traffic routing 
* Monitoring container health
* Configuring applications based on the container in which they will run
* Keeping interactions between containers secure


## How container orchestration works
Container orchestration is a three-step process, often used in iterative agile or DevOps environments. While different tools may vary in methodology, the core process remains the same. Developers use a declarative configuration model where they define the desired application state using configuration files in formats like YAML or JSON.

The configuration file typically specifies:

* The container images that make up the application and where they are stored (registry).
* Provisioning for containers with storage and other resources.
* The network connections between containers and their security.
* Versioning for controlled rollouts (phased or canary).

**The orchestrator handles:**

* Deploying containers and their replicas, selecting the best host based on CPU, memory, and other specified requirements.

* Managing the application lifecycle, including scaling, load balancing, and reallocating resources in case of outages or resource shortages.

* Monitoring the health and performance of the application by collecting logs and telemetry data. This process automates the management and optimal operation of containerized applications across distributed environments.

## **Kubernetes Overview**

Kubernetes is a leading container orchestration platform, often used to deliver Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions. It simplifies infrastructure and operational tasks related to cloud-native development, allowing developers to focus on coding and innovation.

Key Features:
1. Container Deployment:
* Deploys a specific number of containers to hosts.
* Ensures containers remain in a desired state.

2. Rollouts:
* Manages deployment changes.
* Provides options to initiate, pause, resume, or roll back deployments.

3. Service Discovery:
* Automatically exposes containers via DNS names or IP addresses.

4. Storage Provisioning:
* Enables persistent local or cloud storage for containers as needed.

5. Load Balancing and Scalability:
* Distributes traffic across the network during traffic spikes.
* Automatically scales containers to maintain performance.

6.Self-Healing:
* Restarts or replaces containers if they fail.
* Removes containers that don't meet health-check standards.

7.Cloud Provider Support:
* Compatible with major cloud providers.
* Ideal for hybrid or multicloud deployments.

8.Ecosystem of Tools:
* Expanding collection of open-source tools.
* Includes tools like:
  - Knative for serverless workloads.
  - Istio for managing service mesh.
