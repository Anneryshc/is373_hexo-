## [What is Docker?](http://localhost:4000/Docker/)

- **Docker** is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers. **Containers** package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

Furthermore, think of ******Docker containers****** like a shipping container for goods. Just as a shipping container can contain all sorts of items (furniture, books, bicycles) and can be shipped globally without worrying about the contents inside, Docker containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run. This means you don't have to worry about the environment where the application runs because the container keeps it consistent across different environments, making development, testing, and deployment much more predictable and easy to manage.

### Why Do We Use Docker?
- **Consistency Across Environments**: Docker ensures that an application behaves the same way in development, testing, and production environments, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.

- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, including laptops, on-premises servers, and cloud platforms.

- **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS, making them lightweight and faster to start compared to traditional virtual machines.

- **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale applications up or down by adding or removing containers based on demand.

- **Simplifies Application Management**: Docker streamlines the setup and teardown of application environments, making development and testing much quicker.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your computer. You can download them from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

- Feel free to visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/wiki) to learn more in-depth key concepts such as the Docker Kernel, containerization, virtualization, and troubleshooting tips.
 
### Creating a Docker Hub Account
- Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and sign up for an account.
- Once registered, you can create repositories to store your Docker images.

### Logging into Docker Hub from the Command Line
- **`docker login`**
- Enter your Docker Hub username and password.

# Setting Up a Basic Docker Project

## Step 1: Create a Simple Application
Create a directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.

```
mkdir my-docker-app
cd my-docker-app
```
Inside your project directory, create a simple ```app.py``` file with the following content:

```
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class MyHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'Hello, Docker World!\n')

port = int(os.getenv('PORT', 3000))
server = HTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', port), MyHandler)
print(f'Server running on http://localhost:{port}')
server.serve_forever()
```


## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script that defines the instructions to build a Docker image. Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no file extension) in your project directory and add the following content:

### Example Dockerfile for a Simple Python Application

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim
# This line specifies the base image for your application, in this case, a lightweight Python image.

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Sets the working directory inside the Docker container where your application code will reside.

# Copy the requirements file if it exists
COPY requirements.txt ./
# Copies the requirements.txt file from your local machine to the current working directory in the container.

# Install application dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
# Installs the Python dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file without using the cache to reduce the image size.

# Copy the rest of the application source code to the container
COPY . .
# Copies all the files and folders from your local project directory into the container.

# Expose the port your application will run on
EXPOSE 3000
# Exposes port 3000 so your application can be accessed from outside the container.

# Define the command to run your application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
# Specifies the command to run your application when the container starts.

```
If your application has dependencies, make sure to list them in a ```requirements.txt``` file and include it in your project directory.

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image
With your Dockerfile in place, you can build a Docker image for your application. In your project directory, run the following command:

**`docker build -t my-docker-app . `**

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

**`docker run -p 3000:3000 my-docker-app `**

This command maps port 3000 in the container to port 3000 on your host machine, allowing you to access your application in a web browser.

If you want to learn about run options, you can visit [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/)

## Step 5: Access Your Dockerized Application

Open your web browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000.``` You should see "Hello, Docker World!" displayed, indicating that your Dockerized application is running successfully.



## Starting the Services

### Docker Commands
- To start all services defined in your Docker Compose file, navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file and run:
  - **`docker-compose up -d`**
  - This command starts the containers in the background.

## Resetting the Testing Environment
- If you need to reset your environment, e.g., to clear test data:
  - **Stop all services and remove volumes**:
    - **`docker-compose down -v`**
  - **Restart the services**:
    - **`docker-compose up -d`**

### Viewing Logs
- To view logs for troubleshooting or monitoring application behavior:
  - **`docker-compose logs -f`**
  - The `-f` flag tails the log output in real-time.

### Shutting Down
- To stop and remove all running containers:
  - **`docker-compose down`**

## Docker Images

### Building Docker Images
- To build a Docker image for your application, ensure you have a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`. Then run:
  - **`docker-compose build`**

## Pushing Images to Docker Hub

### Tagging Your Docker Image
- Before pushing your image to Docker Hub, tag it with your Docker Hub username and repository:
  - **`docker tag local-image:tagname username/repository:tag`**
  - For example:
    - **`docker tag myapp:latest johndoe/myapp:latest`**

### Pushing the Image
- Push the tagged image to your Docker Hub repository:
  - **`docker push username/repository:tag`**
  - For example:
    - **`docker push johndoe/myapp:latest`**

## Additional Tips
- Ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are correctly set up according to your projectâ€™s needs.
- Use `.env` files to manage environment variables securely.
