      <td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
      <td>Docker is a platform and set of tools for creating, deploying, and managing containers. It allows developers to package an application and all its dependencies into a single, portable container that can run consistently across different environments.</td>
      <td>Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration platform designed to automate containerized applications' deployment, scaling, and management across a cluster of machines.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Primary Function</strong></td>
      <td>Containerization. Docker makes it easy to build, ship, and run containers.</td>
      <td>Orchestration. Kubernetes manages the lifecycle of containers, including load balancing, scaling, and self-healing (restarting failed containers).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Use Case</strong></td>
      <td>Ideal for developers to create isolated environments for applications, simplifying development, testing, and deployment workflows.</td>
      <td>Ideal for running large, complex applications composed of many microservices, and managing containerized applications in production environments.</td>

      <td><strong>Key Differences</strong></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Docker focuses on building and running containers.</li>
          <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Basic orchestration through Docker Swarm.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Scaling is manual and less automated.</li>
          <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Requires additional configuration for load balancing.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Kubernetes manages containers at scale.</li>
          <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Advanced orchestration capabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Excels in automatic scaling based on traffic and resource usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Robust networking model with built-in load balancing features.</li>

      <td><strong>How They Work Together</strong></td>
      <td colspan="2">Docker is used to create and run containers, while Kubernetes manages and orchestrates these containers across multiple hosts, making them work together seamlessly in a production environment.</td>
